**Query:** OpenAI images generate response_format b64_json gpt-image-1 parameter

It looks like you're interested in generating images using the OpenAI API's image capabilities. The `response_format` of `b64_json` indicates that you want the image data returned as a base64-encoded JSON object.

Here’s a simplified overview of how to use this:

1. **API Request**: You would typically send a request to the OpenAI API with the image generation parameters.

2. **Parameters**:
   - `prompt`: Describe the image you want to generate.
   - `response_format`: Set to `b64_json` to get the image data in base64 format.

3. **Handling Response**: The response will include the base64-encoded image. You can then decode this in your application to display or save the image.
